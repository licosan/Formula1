# Formula1
**Simple Mathematical formulas evaluator for PHP**

If you need to evaluate a formula with basic operators and variables, and

- You dont want to use EVAL for obvious security reasons
- You don't want to rely on half the internet as dependancies, but prefer a single self-contained class
- You don't necessarily have the latest PHP version
- You want something readable that you could easily understand and customize.

Then you might like Formula1 ! ;-)
